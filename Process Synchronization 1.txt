--Process Synchronization
-Process----------> Independent
       |----------> Cooperative
-Process Synchroization is the communication of process with each other
-It can happen in single processor system as well as multiple processors system
-It happens in single processor due to concurrent execution
-The interleaving of the process like in round robin algorithm is called concurrent execution
-process communicate within a system using shared memory like global variables
-Since all processes have access to global variables, thus by modifying these global variables, processes can communicate with each other
-Atomic instruction ---> multiple statement executes together(not one after another)
-When Output depends upon sequence of execution of instructions in a concurrent/multi-process/multi-threading environment. This condition is called race condition
-Atomic instruction avoid Race Condition
-Different interleaving(preemptive) cause different output

--Critical Section(Solution of above problem)
-The part of code where you access shared variable is called Critical Section
-Other part of code can be called Non-Critical System
-We can divide the code which requires Synchronization into Criticial Section and Non Critical Section
-Now we need a mechanism(logic) so that only one process executes its Critical Section
-So, we put logic before entering Critical Section
-This logic can be
1. Mutex Lock
2. Semaphore
-The logic before Critical Section is called Entry Point
-The logic after Critical Section is called Exit Point

--Goals of Synchronization Mechanisms( 1 and 2 are mandatory for synchronization)
1. Mutual Exclusion(Only one process should be allowed to enter its Critical Section)
2. Progress(Processes which are not executing in their Critical Section should not be blocking other processes)
3. Bounded Waiting(It should not happen that a process is not entering in its Critical Section and other processes are getting multiple time entry in their Critical Section)
4. Performance(The locking mechanism or logic which allow process to enter in its Critical Section should be fast)
-Two types of Locking mechanism
1. Hardware locking mechanism- It is faster and preffered
2. Software locking mechanism
