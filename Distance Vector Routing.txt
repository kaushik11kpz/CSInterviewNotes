Distance Vector Routing
-Used in ARPANET(the first network that implemented TCP/IP)
-Based on Bellman-Ford Algorithm
-Distance Vector Routing is Distributed Bellman-Ford Algorithm
-The problem with Distance Vector Routing is Count-to-Infinity Problem(very slow convergence in case of failures) 
-Routing Information Protocol(RIP) was based on Distance Vector Routing
-EIGRP by Cisco is another protocol
-Every node sends distance vector to its neighbour nodes
-Distance Vector is shortest distance from this node to every other node

-Because of Count-to-Infinity problem Link State Vector is Used
