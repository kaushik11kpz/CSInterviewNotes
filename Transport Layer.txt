Transport Layer
-At Sender's side it receives data from Application Layer and sends it to Network Layer
-At Receiver's side it receives data from Network Layer and passes it onto Application Layer

-Application and Uses of Transport Layer
-Process to Process Communication
-Uses Port Number
-Every Internet/networking Process is associated with a port number
-Network layer makes sure the packet reaches the web server/destination but which Process is going to consume this packet 
depends on Transport Layer
-Similarily, a device sends or receive many packets in the network, the process which handles this packets is decided by Transport
layer using Port Numbers
-Port Numbers are 16 bit unsigned integers
-Example Well known port numbers
1. 80 - HTTP
2. 443 - HTTPS
3. 53 - DNS
4. 22 - SSH
5. 110 - POP3
6. 25 - SMTP
-Remaining port numbers are randomly assigned by the OS and are mainly used by the client
-Transport Layer is implemented in OS
-Protocol provided by Transport Layer
1. TCP
2. UDP

-The TCP connection happens using Socket API
-Socket API is main part of Transport Layer and is used by Network Programmer
- Sender/Client side                     Receiver's/Server Side
  socket()                         socket()
  connect()                        bind()
  write()                          listen()
  read()                           accept()
  close()                          read() 
                                   write()
                                   close()

-The above APIs are provided as System Calls by most of the OS
-Theproramming languages has library function bilt on top of these APIs
-The above is only for TCP not for UDP
-HTTP,DNS,RPC,HTTPS work on top of TCP
