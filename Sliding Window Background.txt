-The problems with Stop and Wait is that it is not utilizing the Channel efficiently

-Sliding Window Protocol better utlizes efficinecy of channel especially if Bandwidth and Distance is high
   -Bandwidth Delay Product = Bandwidth + Roundtrip Time
   -BDP = B+2Tp
   -It indicates capacity of your channel
   -Capacity depends on
    1.Bandwidth
    2.Cross-Section Area
   -It idicates how many bits can be there in channel at particular time
   -If BDP, Stop and wait does not efficiently apply, Sliding Window is well utilized
   -TCP window Sliding Windw alot
