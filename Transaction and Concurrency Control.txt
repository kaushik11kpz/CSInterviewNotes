---ACID Properties
-A Database transaction should be completed fully or should not happen at all
-Transaction and Concurrency is ensured by four properties of DBMS known as ACID Properties
  -Atomicity - Whole Transaction or Nothing
  -Consistency - Should remain consistent at the end of Trasaction
  -Isolation - Multile Transaction should not interfere with one another, every transaction should be done alone
  -Durability - Changes are durable
-Concurrency is a procedure in DBMS which helps us for the management of two simultaneous processes to 
execute without conflicts between each other, these conflicts occur in multi user systems.
-If a single transaction is happening, then DBMS has only to handle rollback/commit changes, but for multiple transactions
Concurrency Control comes in place
-If DBMS server responds to requests(transactions) serially, it response becomes very slow, thus
-To optimize the performance of DBMS server, we allow multiple transaction(user request) occuring 
at same time in interleaved(concurent) fashion
-Multiple transaction might be accessing same data items and might be reading and writing them
-If Concurrency is allowed, it creates problems
-We check whether interleaving(concurrent execution) is valid or not
-If T1 and T2 are transactions, T1T2 and T2T1, both are allowed. This is known as Schedule and we say that this 
schedule is serializable(T1 finishes then T2 or vice versa)
-If the schedule is equivalent T1T2 or T2T1, this is called serializable schedule
-Serializability is used to validate interleaved(concurrent execution) schedule

--Serializability
-View Serializability
-Conflict Serializability


---View Seriliazability
-It is required/needed
-Difficult to check
-To check whether the generated schedule is View equivalent of generated schedule
-If generated schedule is View equivalent then it is View Serializability
-

---Conflict Serializability
