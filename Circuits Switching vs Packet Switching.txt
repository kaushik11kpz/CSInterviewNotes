-Circuit Switching
 -Used in Telephone and Cellular Networks
 -In this,
 1.Esablish connection(bandwidth allocated)
 2.Use connection(use bandwidth)
 3.Close connection(release bandwidth)

-If a person wants to talk to a web server in US
 -A sender sends the requests and receivers sends a response
 -These requests and response is divided into Packets
 -These Individual Packets is routed through network
 -Every packet has destination address
 -Individual packets may be routed independently(two packets may take different path for same destination)
 -Since, all these packets go through router, which have a buffer queue
 -The reason for two packet taking different paths because once, the buffer queue is full(congested), it drops the packets

-This method of Storing and Forwarding of Packets is called Store and Forward Packet Switching
-It provides efficient utilization of Links
-This is called Statistical Mutliplexing(Multiplexing over single link)

-Two ways to do Packet Switching
1.Virtual Circuits
-Uses concept of Circuit Switching
-Have a fixed connectionn setup
-Packets have circuit idenification
-Failures are hard to fix
2.Datagram(mostly used)
-Messages are dividd into packets
-Connection is not fixed
-Packets have destination address
-Routers decide the next hop of packets depends on failures and congestion
-Routing tables on routers are contiuously updated according to congestion, shortest path, etc.
-Mostly problems are handed by Transport Layer since IP os connection-less,unreliable
