-Routing algorithms decides the path a packet should take to reach its destination
-Two forms of Routing Algorithm
 1. Exterior Gateway Protocol - Used for routing across Autonomous Systems
  Ex- Border Gateway Protocol(BGP)
 2. Interior Gateway Protocol - Used for routing inside Autonomous System
   A) Distance Vector
     -It is based on Bellman Ford
     Ex- 1. Routing Information Protocol(RIP)
         2. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP)
   B) Link State
     -It is based on Dijsktra's Algorithm
     Ex- 1. IS-IS
         2. OSPF

-Static vs Dynamic Routing Algorithm
-Unicast vs Broadcast vs Multicast va Anycast

-How do we decide cost of links
 1. Bandwidth
 2. Network Delay
 3. Hop Count
 4. Path Cost
 5. Load
 6. Maximum Transmission Unit
