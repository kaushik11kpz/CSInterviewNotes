ARP
-Address Resolution Protocol is used to get MAC address of a device with given IP address
-When a device in a network wants to connect to other device
-Since it knows the IP address of gateway router but it needs MAC adress of gateway router
-Thus, that device will send a LAN broadcast message, this broadcast goes to every device in that LAN
-This is an ARP request requesting MAC address of given IP address
-Now the router responds to ARP request with ARP response message and response message has mapping of IP address to MAC address
-The device prepares a data link layer frame from IP datagram with destination MAC addresS as Gateway Router MAC address
-This deice will nonw store the MAC address in cache for future use 
-ARP Cache
 -Storing Mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses
 -Low expiration times as IP addresses change quickly
-RARP
 -earlier used to get IP address for a MAC address
 -Replaced by DHCP
