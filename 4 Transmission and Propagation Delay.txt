---Different Delay in CN
1. Transmission Delay
-Time taken by Sender to put data on the channel for trasmission
-It depends upon 
  1. Link Bandwidth
  2. Packet Length
-Transmissio Delay = Packet Length/Link Bandwidth

2. Propagation Delay
-Time taken by last bit of packet to reach from Sender to Receiver
-Depends on 
  1. Distance
  2. Velocity
-Propagation Delay = Distance/Velocity
-Velocity depend on Medium such as Fibre Optical, Copper wire, coaxial cable etc

3. Queuing Delay
-The time a packet waits in queue of router is called queuing delay
-Depends on traffic of router 

4. Processing Delay
-The time taken by router/receiver to Process(Encrypy/Decrypt and process the header) a packet
-Depend on load/computing power of router/receiving

-Total delay(t) is in sending a pcket from sender to a receiver
-t = tt + tp + tq + tp
