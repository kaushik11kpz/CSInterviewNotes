-You are given a range of IP addresses
-You divide this range into multiple subranges
-and assign these subranges to different departments
-This is subnetting

-Subnetting is defined by a term called Subnet mask
-Subnet mask is squence of 1's followed by sequence of 0's
-It is of 32 bits
-Ex - 255.0.0.0
-The bits that are 1 indicates Network addresses
-So in 255.0.0.0, 8 bits are Network addresses
-For a Subnet mask 255.255.0.0 that means the network address in this subnetwork for all the devices has 16 bits
-All the devices within a subnet will have the same Subnet mask
-Number of 1 bits in a Subnet Mask tells number of bits which are used to identify Network address
-Number of 0 bits tels the host id within a network
-So all the device within a subnet shares the same Subnet mask and the number of 1 bits identifies you the network address
and number of 0 bits tells you the host Id bits

-Subnetting is the idea of diving your range IP addresses into multiple subnetworks so that these subnetworks can co-operate
independently and can share their own devices, security can be achieved within subnetworks. 
-It is done by taking some leading bits of host Id from Classfull addresses and we make new and bigger Network Id for individual
subnets 

- IP address of a device on a particular network - 192.168.13.3
                     Subnet Mask of this network - 255.255.255.0 
                                   (bitwise AND) & _______________
              Network address of this IP address - 192.169.13.0 N/w address

-The purpose of Subnet mask is that it tells you how many bits are used to identify network and the remaining bits are used to
identify host within a network

-Broadcast goes to every device in that network and every device sees and gives response to it
-Use of Broadcast addresses, Ex - DHCP, ARP
-Routing tabel also contains Subnet Mask which is Bitwise AND with IP address to find out the network address where the information
should go

-Subnet of Unequal sizes
-Variable Length Subnet Masking(VLSM)
