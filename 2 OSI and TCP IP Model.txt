Computer Networks Models
1. OSI
2. TCP/IP

--In Computer Networks 
-Protocols are set of rules used by two devices to communicate(Ex- HTTP, IP, TCP, UDP, SMTP)
-These set of rules are decided typically by the Headers
-These Headers specify the content of the message, details and position of the message and how this message to be processed
-These Headers can be destination address, source address checksum of the message to do error detection
-Sender attches the header to the message
-Receiver side removes and processes the Header, as it where is what information in the header
-Then receiver forwards the message to the upper layer


--Need of Layering
-The idea of the Layering is that to oraganize all the protocols in different layers according to their utlization
-Since HTTP is an Application(Top) layer protocol, it does not have to implement anything provided by lower layer protocol
-HTTP may assume that all the services provided by lower level are already available
-HTTP protocol is depend on ethernet or wifi
-Http implements its ow application layer services
-All Computer networks and Internet can be considered as collection of Protocols and Layers
-In CN, you have layers and every layer have certain set of protocols and devices communicate using these protocols
-All these protocols are part of certain layer
-These Protocols asume that the services of lower layer are available to them and they just have to implement their service
in their layer


1. OSI Model(Open System Interconnection)
-7 layers
 7.Application
 6.Presentation
 5.Session
 4.Transport
 3.Network
 2.Data Link
 1.Physical

-Sender send info/request using HTTP protocol of application layer
-The Presentation layer adds it Header to the message from upper layer(Application layer)
-The Session layer adds its Header to the message coming from Presentation layer
-This goes on, till Data Link Layer adds it Header to upper layer message
-This is transported through physical(wire/wireless) to Receiver
-Receiver's receive the message and its Data Link Layer interprets/processes Header of Sender's DLL Header,removes it and passes
remaining to Upper Layers.
-Thus, at the end, receiver's Application Layer receives HTTP message from Sender's Application layers and responds accordingly

-Layering helps in encapsulation(only relevant receiver's layer interacts with its counterpart from Sender's layer)


--Functionality of Different Layer
1. Physical
-Wire/Wireless 
-Copper, Fibre Optic
-01010 - Binary
-Signals

2. Data Link Layer(DLL)
-It uses Physical Medium to do communication
-It is responsible by communciation in LAN
-It provides access in shared medium
-It provides one device to another device communication
-Switch, Ethernet, Wifi, Bluetooth
-Protocols -  802.11, 802.3
-Switch processes DLL Header
-Error Control/Detection - handling as it uses Physical Medium
-Flow Control Handle
-Collison Handling -  should be avoided in shared medium

3. Network Layer
-If you wani to connect to a device which is not directly connected to you, you need to have services of Network Layer
-It routes data from local network to distant networks. It helps in finding routes to distant networks
-Device - Router
-Router forwards/routes info to distant networks from local networks
-Multiple routers are involved in connecting to distant networks
-All routing happens through Network Layer
-Protocol - IP
-Network Layer is implemented by IP Protocol
-IP Protocol is part of TCP/IP Model, practical model
-IP Protocol is connection-less protocol, not reliable
-OSI says that Network Layer may provide reliable/non-reliable protocol

4. Transport Layer
-The end to end delievery, whether to deliever to browser, email, telnet, ssh login, terminal etc. is decided by Transport Layer
-End to end delievery
-It decides which process in computer should be receiving this information/message
-OSI says Transport layer can provide 5 different types of services
-Type 0 means, it provides few services to upper layer, Type 4 means it provides all services to upper layer
-These services are connection establishment, connection release, flow control, error control
-In Internet, Transport layer implements TCP, UDP protocols
-TCP protocol has all functionalities, establishes connection, connection oriented, error and control flow
-UDP protocol provide no such services

5. Session Layer
-No Session Layer in TCP/IP model
-In OSI, it does session management and autentication(These things in TCP/IP model are implemented in Application Layer itself)
-Session Layer helps in sunchronizing videos with voice and images(Combining of multiple streams)
-Synchronizing web pages with image,text etc.

6. Presentation Layer
-Not part of TCP/IP model
-Data Compression on sender side and decompression on Receiver's side
-Encoding of data in specfic format to be sent over to the network and decoding at the Receiver's side
-Encryption and Decryption

7. Application Layer
-Applications like web browser, email client, skype, teams, etc work at these layer
-Application Layer use Transport Layer services to do their work
-Application Layer Protocol
 1. HTTP(Web Browsing)
 2. SMTP(emails)
 3. DNS(Domain Name System) like findig the IP address of a URL
 4. FTP(File ransfer System)
 5. SSH(Secure login on server for remote login)


--TCP/IP Model
-4 Layers
 4. Application
 3. Transport
 2. Network
 1. Link

1. Link Layer
-Does both, physical and data link layer
-It provides all the functionalities of DLL

2. Network Layer
-As per TCP/IP, it is always unreliable, connection-less
-IP Protocol

3. Transport Layer
-All functionalies provided in OSI

4. Application Layer
-Same as OSI
-It implements application using the services of the Transport Layer

-Protocols data unit of different protocols of each Layer
1. Application Layer
-Protocols-HTTP,FTP,SMTP,DNS
-Unit of communication(Protocol Data Unit) - Message

2. Transport Layer
-Protocol- UDP, TCP
-Unit of communication(Protocol Data Unit) - Segment

3. Network Layer
-Protocol - IP
-Unit of communication(Protocol Data Unit) - Packet

4. Link Layer
-Protocol - Ethernet, Wifi, Bluetooth
-Unit of communication(Protocol Data Unit) - Frame
