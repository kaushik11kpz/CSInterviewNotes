CIDER - Classless Inter Domain Routing
-The idea of CIDER is based on both Classfull addressing and Subnetting
-It is an improvement over Classfull addressing using the concept of Subnetting
-For an ISP, with sepcififc requirement it was hard to purchase specific IPs which are needed
-To Solve this problem CIDER was introduced
-CIDER puts boundaries in bits
-Ex - 23 bits for N/W Id
    - 9 bits for host Id
-The problem solved is 
  If need host IP addresses = 500
  Provided host IP addresses = 512(vey less difference)

  If nedd host IP address = 1800
  Provided host IP addresses  = 2048

-A block of IP addresses is allocated from 2^32 IP addresses and the number of IP addresses is allocated of thw power of 2
-Last n bits of starting range of allocated host Id must be 0  
-Last n bits of ending range of allocated host Id must be 1

-Alternate way of representing IP addresses (CIDER Notation)
-193.10.10.1/23 ------> This represent both IP address and Subnet mask
-23 here represents, subnet mask(number of bits in network Id) in 193.10.10.1 is of 23 bits
-Subnet Mask need not to be represented explicitly

-CIDER makes allocation of IP addresses more efficient without any wastage of IP addresses
-Introduced in 1990
