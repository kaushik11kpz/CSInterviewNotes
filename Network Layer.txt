---In OSI Layer - Network Layer
   In TCP/IP Layer - IP Layer

-Protocol - IP
-Device - Router
-Algorithm - Routing Algorithm
 -Router does Internetworking
 -One interface of router is part of local network and other is connected to Internet
 -Internet has multiple Autonomous System and these Autonoumous System has multiple Routers in them which are interconnected
 -Autonomous system are ISPs or large Organizations
 -Routers carry traffic through Internet
 -Routers has multiple interfaces which allow them to connect with multiple different types of Networks
 -Routers have routing table which contains addresses of other routers/devices)
 -Building Routing table and deciding where to send these packets is called Routing which is global
 -Forwarding is local as it is already decided where to send packets
 
-Services offered by Network Layer
 1. Internetworking(802.11,3G,Ethernet)
 2. Addressing
 3. Routing and Forwarding
 4. Scalability(using Hierarchy in Networks)
 5. Bandwidth Control
 6. Fragementation and Re-assembly
