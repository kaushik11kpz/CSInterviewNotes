----Process Scheduler
-It is movement of one state to another
-This is done by OS using schedulers
-These schedulers are called Process schedulers
-Types of Process Schedulers
1. Long term schedulers
-It moves processes from hardisk to RAM(to Ready state)
-It controls degree of multi-programming(meaning how many processes you have in RAM)
-Ideally, it brings a good mix of I/O bound and CPU bound prcoesses
--A process is called I/O bound if it does Input/Outpt most of the time. This gives free time to CPU
--A process is called CPU bound id it uses CPU most of the time. This takes more CPU time
2. Short term schedulers
-It moves processes from Ready to Running state
-It also calls dispatcher
-It assigns processor to one of the picked processes.
-It runs actively by OS as compared to Long term scheduler
--Dispatcher does Process Control Switch
3. Medium term schedulers
-The last two states Suspended/Block, Suspended/Ready are done by medium term schedulers
-Moves processes from Waiting state to Suspend/Block state and also resumes back from that state
-Moves processes from Ready state to Suspend/Ready state
