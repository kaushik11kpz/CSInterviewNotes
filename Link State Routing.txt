Link State Routing
-Based on Dijkstra's algorithm
-It does work in 2 phases
 1. Flooding
  -Every node shares it neighbour information with everybody else in the network
  -While flooding, if a router sees the same packet again, it simply ignores the packet
  -Now every node has information about the whole graph/network
 2. After having the complete graph information every node independently run dijkstra's algorithm as every node knows the shortest
   path to every body else
  
-Link State Routing is widely used in practice
-Link State Routing is used in Standard protocol OSPF
-OSPF is the most used routing Protocol
-IS-IS protocol is Intermediate Sytem to Intermediate System
-OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First protocol

-In Flooding, every node maintains source and Sequence number of a packet received
-If a sequence number of a packet received is old, the packet is discarded
-As soon as Link goes down or router is gone the information is flooded to everyone else using Link State Routing
-To handle corrupted Sequnce number concept of Ageing is used
