-Two protocols on Transport Layer
1. TCP
2. UDP

-TCP
-It is a heavyweight protocol
-It establishes a connection
-Ensures Flow Control
-Ensures better Error Control
-Ensure order of Packets

-If you want to build an Application on top of TCP, you have to
-first call connect and web servr will be accepting your connection
-That means, three packets are send just to establish a connection

-Three Way Handshake(Only in TCP)
-You as a Client will sends a Sequence number to server, the server will send an Acknowledgement and then you will send and an
Acknowledgement

-IN TCP
-Sender's and Receiver's will both be maintaining windows
-Both will be doing Congestion Control
-If the congestion is there, that will slow down the rate of sending'
-It provides reliability
-HTTP, SMTP, FTP, HTTPS

-UDP
-It simply sends whatever you sends through Network Layer
-Not much overhead
-Source Port(16 bit), Destination Port(16 bit), Length(16 bit), Checksum(16 bit) - Total 8 byte
-DNS, VoIP, DHCP, Network Time Protocol, Oniline games uses UDP
-Multitasking, Broadcasting

-When an Application Developer builds a network application,
 -it creates a Socket
 -While creating a socket, it is decided whether we want to use TCP(TCP socket) or UDP(UDP socket) using above reasoning and requirements
