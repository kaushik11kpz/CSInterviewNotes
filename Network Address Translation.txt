-The Problem is there are 2^32 IP address = 4.3 billion
-Which is almost exhausted as the number of devices currently in use are far greater than 4.3 billion
-To solve this, Network Address Translation(NAT) is used

NAT
-The idea of NAT is based on Private Network Address
-Class A,B,C are private IP addresses
-Class C IP addresses which are private are used most of the time in small networks
-When ISP provides a router, the devices at home gets private IP addresses
-The devices at home/office gets private IP addresses
-Since, the router has two or more interfaces, the interface which is connected to home network have private IP addresses
-The Interface which is connected to Internet has public IP address
-These public IP addresses are routable addresses which are identified by outside Private or public networks
-Private IP address are used for locally or privately in a network
-So, home network is connected through One public IP address of router

How we access Internet from home
-Routers/Wifi Access Points also includes a NATBox
-These NATBox changes source IP address of the Packet which goes to the Outside world
-Whenever a request goes from local device to outside network, at router the NATBox changes the source IP address from IP address of local device(private IP address) to Public IP address
of that router
-The NATBox also maintains internal mapping of local IP address to router public IP address for response to be delievered to that exact local device
-In response, NATBox again changes destination address from public IP address to local IP address 
-It maintains internal mapping by using TCP and UDP port number to identify devices which are locally connected to NATBox
