---Background for Scheduling Algorithms
-Different Queues
1. Ready Queue - keep ready state process in a queue - for scheduling algorithms
2. Job Queue - keep new state process in a queue
3. I/O Queue - It is for I/O devices(multiple devices have their own I/O queues)
-Short term scheduler job is to pick one of the process from the ready queue
-After it, dispatcher does context switch/mode switch, it also makes process jump to the line where to begin it.
-These scheduling algorithms are for short term scheduler or for the process which are in ready queue

--When a process is picked by short term scheduler(when a short term scheduler is called)
-When some other process moves from running to waiting(when itself is stops for I/O operations)
-When some process moves from running to ready(when stopped by processor) - preemptive scheduling algorithm is used by short term scheduler which can stop a process from running state
-When a new/existing (high priority) process moves to ready state - preemptive scheduling algorithm  is used by short term scheduler which can stop a process from running state
-When a process terminates

--Different Times used in scheduling algorithm
-Time frame in CPU schedulng are generally represented using Ghantt Chart
-We represent activity of CPU(processor)
-Points on Time Frame
1. Arrival Time
- The time at which a process arrives
2. Completion Time
- The time at which a process is completed/terminates

-Difference between two points in Time Frame
1. Burst Time
-Total time a process takes
2. Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
-Difference between Completion Time and Arrival Time
3. Waiting Time = Turn Around Time - Burst Time
-The time a processs spends in Ready Queue(time in which other process except current is running in processor)
4. Response Time
-Difference between Arrival Time and the first time this process gets CPU(processor)

--Goals of Scheduling Algorithm
-Maximum CPU Utilization
-Maximum Throughput(maximu job per second)
-Minimum Turn Around Time
-Minimum Waiting Time
-Minimum Response Time
-Fair CPU Allocation(No starvation)
