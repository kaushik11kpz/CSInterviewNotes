-Error and Flow Control happens in
1. Transport layer-It works on IP protocol which is conection-less, not reliable
2. Data Link Layer - It works on top of Physical Layer

-These problems of Error and Flow Control is handled by Protocols such as
 1. Stop and Wait ARQ/Alternaing Bit Protocol(as sequence numbers are 0 and 1)
 -After sending a frame, sender waits for Acknowledgement(ACK), once it arrives, it sends another frame
 -Look For the Images in Notes for proper description
 -Stop and Wait algorithm must handle
 1.Flow Control
 2.Lost Data
 3.Lost ACK/Frame
 4.Delayed Data/Frame
 5.Delayed ACK
  -Flow control handle
    -After sending a frame, sender waits for Acknowledgement(ACK), once it arrives, it sends another frame
  -Timeout 
    -It is a period till which a sender waits for ACK, once it doesn't receive ACK till timeout, it sends Frame Again
    -It handles Lost Frame/Data
  -Sequence Number for Lost ACK
    -Sender uses, a sequence number fir every frame, if ACK is lost, sender's send it again(same sequence number), 
     receiver acknowledge it as same frame and ignores it and sends the ACK back
  -For Delayed ACK
    -We use Sequence number in ACK
    -This Sequence number tells the sender next frame expected by Receiver
