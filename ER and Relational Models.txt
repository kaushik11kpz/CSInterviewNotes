---Entity Relationship Model
-Designing of databases
-ER models is used to design databases
-Once design is finalized, then we start implementation
-ER models consists of
1. Entity Set - Noun (Student,Teacher,Course)
2. Relationship Set - Verb(studies,teaches,taught)
3. Attributes - (Name, Start date, End date)

---ER diagrams
-Entity Set - represented using Rectangle
-Relationship Set - represented using Diamond
-Attributes - represented using Oval or Eclipse
   -Attributes are of many types:
   1.Composited attribute
      -Name
      -Address
   2.Normal attribute
   3.Multivalued - It is represented using double oval or double eclipse
      -Mobile Number
   4.Derived attribute - Represented using dotted oval or dotted eclipse
      -Age - It can be derived from DOB
      -Duration - It can be derived from Start Date, End Date
   5.Key attribute - Represented using an oval with underlined
      -Enrollment Number - A student can be identified with just Enrollment Number

---ER diagrams Relationship
--Degree of Relationship Sets
1. Unary - One Entity Set is connected(related) to itself
2. Binary(Most used) - One Entity is connected(related) to another Entity
3. N-ary - One Entity is connected(related) to multiple Entities

--Cardinality
1. One to One - One Entity Set of both sides participates
  Ex- Driver(Entity Set) drives(relationship) a Car(Entity Set)
2. One to Many - One Entity Set of one side and many Entity Sets of other side participates
  Ex- One Professor(Single Entity Set) teaches(relationship) Many Courses(Multiple Entity Sets)
  Ex- Many Student(Multiple Entity Sets) studies(relationship) Single Course(Single Entity Set)
3. Many to Many - Many Entity Sets of Both sides participates
  Ex- Many Customers(Multiple Entity Sets) buys(relationship) Many Products(Multiple Entity Sets)

---ER Participation and Weak Entity Set
--Participation of Entities in Relationships
1. Total Participation - Represented using double lines
                      - Every Entity of one side participates in the relationship
2. Partial Participation

--Weak Entity Set
-An Entity Set is called Weak Entity Set if it Does not have its own Primary Key
-These Weak Entity Set always has Total Participation
Ex - Sections of a Class are Weak Entity Set, thus Section Entity Set takes a key of a class
-Weak Entity Set takes key of Entity Set
-Ex- 1.Class Id with  section Id
     2.Employee Id with Dependent Id
     3. Host with Login


---Key
-It is an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies a particular entity

1. Candidate Key - One or more than one in number
- It is a minimal set of attribute that derive all other attributes
Ex - Adhar Number
   - Enrollment Number
   - Pan Number
- It has to be distinct
- Non null
- No extra attribute, minimal
2. Primary Key - only one in number for a Table
-Out of all the Candidate key, we pick one key as a Primary Key
-Ex - Enrollment Number
-It has to be distinct
-Non null
-Primary key is the key on which most query is done
-Databases store data according to Primary Key
3. Alternate Key - One or More than One in number
-All candidate Key which are not Primary key are secondary Key
4. Super Key - Greater than or equal to Candidate Key
-Any set of attributes that uniquely identify a row is a Super Key
-It is non minimal
-Candidate key + any other key =  Super Key i.e (Candidate key + any other key must uniquely identify rows)
-Minimizing Super Key, it becomes Candidate Key
-Non null

---Foreign Key
-To minimize redundancy, while designing databases, we put data in different table
-In doing so, some column of one table is closely related to some column of another table
-A Foreign key typically refers to Primary key or Unique Key of some other Table or same Table
-Use REFERENCES to create Foreign key
  Ex - Customer_ID REFERENCES Table_Name(Primary Key of Mentioned Table) 
     - Customer_ID REFERENCES Customer(Customer_ID) 
-Alter Table can also be used to add Foreign Key Constraint

--Referential Integrity
-Since data is in both table i.e Order and Customer
-If Customer Deletes its Account, to mantain Referential Integrity DBMS provides some method to handle them
Ex- ON DELETE CASCADE - It says if one entry is deleted from deleted, deleted the related entry from other Table also
-Other methods are, Null, Restrict, etc.
-These method ensure Referential Integrity
